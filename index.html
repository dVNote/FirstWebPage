      <h1>Welcome to dVNote</h1>
      <p class="date">September 1, 2024</p>

      <p>At dVNote, we are developing a new tool for innovators.</p>
        
      <p>Many of us ask, “How do I think outside the box?” The common answer, “Be creative,” often lacks practical guidance. Creativity is not a genetic trait but a skill that can be developed through specific practices. Our mission is to enable everyone to engage in these practices for innovation.</p>

      <p>Drawing inspiration from the Renaissance and Leonardo da Vinci—reflected in our name, dVNote, short for da Vinci Notebook—we combine recent research with advancements in generative AI to enhance the creative process. Our platform supports and augments human creativity with AI, aiming to unlock the potential for innovation in everyone.</p>

      <p>Our first product will assist users in starting their innovation journey by encouraging conscious observation of their environment. As users develop these skills, we will continue to evolve our platform and features, leveraging the full potential of our AI engine.</p>

      <p>We are conducting a brief survey to understand how professionals document ideas, use technology, and face challenges in their creative processes. The survey takes 3-5 minutes to complete, and all responses are anonymous. We appreciate your participation and encourage you to share the survey with your network.</p>
